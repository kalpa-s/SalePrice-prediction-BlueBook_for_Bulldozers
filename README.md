# SalePrice-prediction-BlueBook_for_Bulldozers
 This repo contains code for [Blue Book for Bulldozers competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/bluebook-for-bulldozers), hosted by Kaggle.<br>
## Aim of this project (Problem Definition)
 * Forecast / Predict the future sale price of a bulldozer based on its features and historical data of similar bulldozers sold.
 * We are attempting to predict a number so the problem we are exploring is a <b>Regression problem</b>.<br>
 * There is a time attribute associated to the dataset, so this is a <b>Time Series problem</b>, as we have to analyze a sequence of data points collected over an interval of time.
 
## Dataset
* The data is downloaded from the Kaggle Bluebook for Bulldozers competition: [https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data)
* The dataset contains 412,698 rows and 52 features, with <b>"SalePrice"</b> being the target column.
* Kaggle provides a [data dictionary](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data) which contains information about what each attribute of the dataset means.
